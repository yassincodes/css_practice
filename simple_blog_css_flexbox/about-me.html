                <h2>My name is yassin and living the simple life saved my life</h2>
                <p><strong>I used to be a pack rat</strong>. I had so many things that I thought that I loved, but the truth was I couldn't even appreciate any of it because there was too much.</p>
                <p>Things were terrible. I had a job that I hated, a home that I didn't want to live in, and I couldn't hold a relationship.</p>
               
                <h3>Now I live the simple life</h3>
                <p>I'm living a simple life, things are so much better. I'm less stressed, enjoy life and work more, and I have more free time to enjoy.</p>
                <p>With how much it turned my life around, <strong>I felt like I had no choice but to start sharing how I did it</strong>, and how others can benefit from living a simple life as well, which is why I started this site!</p>
